# Knowledge Base: BabloCommander Project

This file summarizes the structure, contents, and suggestions for improvement of the BabloCommander Project.

## Files and Directories Overview

1. **Design_Document.md** - ASCII text: Contains the design document of the project.
2. **TBotRemote** - directory: Contains the Telegram bot application.
3. **bot.txt** - ASCII text: Contains the bot token, consider removing it or storing it in a more secure way.
4. **db** - directory: Contains the databases such as user-specific spending data.
5. **my_telegram_bot.py** - Python script text executable, ASCII text: An initial version of the bot script, consider whether it should be kept.
6. **org** - directory: Contains text files organizational moments & knowledge base.
7. **the_way.md** - ASCII text: Contains the initial draft of the design document and knowledge base of the project.

## Recommendations

1. Store sensitive data, like the bot token, as environment variables rather than within the code or in plain text files, for better security.
2. The `my_telegram_bot.py` file seems like a leftover from an early version of the bot. Consider whether it should be kept, and if yes, maybe move it to an archive or old_versions directory. If its contents are no longer relevant, consider deleting it.
3. Each user directory in `db` contains a settings file, which is a neat way to personalize the bot per user. The daily spending data is also well-structured and logically organized.

Overall, the project is organized well with a logical structure, making it easy to navigate and understand, while maintaining best practices for writing and maintaining the bot script.
